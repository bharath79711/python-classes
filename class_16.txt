 Git â€“ Core Concepts:-


- Version Control System: Git tracks changes in source code during software development.
- Snapshots, not differences: Git saves the entire state of a project, not just the changes.
- Local-first: You work locally and push changes to remote repositories when ready.
- Branches: Create isolated environments for features or fixes (git branch, git checkout).
- Merge & Rebase: Combine changes from different branches (git merge, git rebase).
- Staging Area: Prepare changes before committing (git add, git commit).
- Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the repository.


ðŸ”— GitHub â€“ Collaboration Platform:-

- Remote Hosting: GitHub hosts Git repositories online.
- Pull Requests: Propose changes and review code before merging.
- Issues & Discussions: Track bugs, enhancements, and collaborate.
- Actions: Automate workflows like testing and deployment.
- Forking: Copy someoneâ€™s repo to your account to experiment independently.
- Stars & Watch: Bookmark and follow projects you like.
