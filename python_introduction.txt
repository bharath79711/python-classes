                                   PYTHON


Introduction:-

Python is a high level Interpreted,Dynamic,Functional programming language.
 Easy to write and understanding ,Scripting , object oriented.

It is used for:-

web development,software development (server-side),
mathematics,system scripting.
Example:
print("Hello, World!")

Dynamic programming language:-

   In Python, being a dynamic language means that type checking is
   done at runtime rather than compile time.Variables in Python do not have fixed
   types—you can assign a value of one type to a variable and later reassign a value
   of a different type without any issues


examples
x = 10      # x is an integer
x = "hello" # Now x is a string


Interpreted programming language:-

 Python is an interpreted programming language, meaning its code is executed
 line by line at runtime rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.
 The Python interpreter reads and executes each statement dynamically, allowing for
 flexibility and ease of debugging.

                       Comparison between Java and python

Data Types:-

           Integers  = 0,1,2,3,4….-1,-2,-3,......

           Float   =  0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,......-0.1,-0.2,-0.3,.....

          String  =  “ abcd…ghij….ABCDEF…….

           Boolean  = True or False


Examples:-

       X = 10 ( integer)

       Y = 3.5 ( float )

       Z = x+y     , print(z) = 13.5




String:-

   I = “Bharath”         j = “Ashok”

   print(i+j) = Bharathanu

Xx  = “123”    yy = “132.5”
Print ( xx + yy ) =  123132.5


Conditions:-

           Str + Str = add

           Str * Str =  Multi

           Int + Int = add

           Int + Float = add

           Float + Float = add

           Int + Str = error
                                              :-  called  Concatenation Error
           Float + Str = error


G = ‘’’ Helo bharath’’’
                                      :-   Is also Strings
G = “””Helo bharath”””

Boolean:-
          X =10        Y =3.5   Z = “Bharath”    K = “Ashok”

                  print(X>Y)  = True

                  print(X<Y) =  False

                  print(Z = K) = False
